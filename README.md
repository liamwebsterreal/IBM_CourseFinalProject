# About:
## Supervised ML:
### Regression(Final Project):
In this project I will apply the skills and knowledge learned throughout the IBM EDA course on Coursera. I will select a dataset from the ones used in the Course or any other dataset of interest and apply all of the demonstrated techniques including, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Visualization, and Hypothesis Testing.
### Classification(Final Project):
In this project I will apply the skills and knowledge learned through the first 3 of 6 course in IBM's ML Professional Certification curriculum. I have selected a data set about student success. I will perform data cleaning and initial EDA techniques before engineering multiple classification models to find a fit model to predict if a student will find success or failure. The project is mostly focused on interpretability. To address this a surrogate model will likely be used.
