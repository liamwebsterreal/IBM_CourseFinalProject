# About:
In this project I will apply the skills and knowledge learned throughout the IBM EDA course on Coursera. I will select a dataset from the ones used in the Course or any other dataset of interest and apply all of the demonstrated techniques including, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Visualization, and Hypothesis Testing.
